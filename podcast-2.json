Thank you so much for joining me today on our podcast as a part of our EVIT series. Today I have a very distinguished lady. Her name is Hale Yama. She is the Senior Director for Engineering at Coursero. We've known her for a while and we are very familiar with her accomplishments, but I'd like to take this opportunity to get to know her a little more and to share her experiences with us on a bigger forum. So, Hale, welcome to the show. Thank you for having me. Good to see you, Pallavi. Absolutely. It's a pleasure to see you. And Hale, to just start this conversation, can you tell us a little bit about your journey in technology and where you started, where you have come and how? Sure. So, I am the first woman in my family to attend and graduate from college in a technical field. After finishing up my bachelor's in computer science, I started working as a developer in Turkey, which is where I'm from, and heard that for a software engineer, Silicon Valley was a place to be. So I moved to San Francisco Bay Area in the year 2000. In my 27 years of experience in the industry, I worked in various domains, including finance, mobile apps, B2B, education, in different sizes of companies from really small startups to the big tech giants. And I was a developer in the first half of it and an engineering leader in the second half. I am currently a senior director of engineering at Core Zero, which is a popular learning platform used by a global community of students and educators. I am also a leadership and executive coach, and I'm passionate about diversifying the tech space and an advocate and public speaker for women in technology in particular. Yes, that totally ties in with our efforts to amplify women's voices too. So, with you being in the industry for so long, having broken the barriers of your own family first and the education levels that you'd always seen, broken that barrier, you've come to a foreign land, and you've been in technology, but you were generally more real dominated earlier, especially a few years, still a few years ago. Can you share how you broke through, how you managed to get the voice heard, how that experience was? Yeah, it was never easy, honestly. As a woman, I was always the minority. I went to a science high school and we were maybe like a 10%, 10 to 15% of my class. It was a little bit better in the technical university I attended in the CS, one third of it were women. And when I started working, the ratio dropped tremendously. I was actually worked for a few companies where I was the only women engineer. And it got better over time, but dropped again when I moved to leadership positions. So my tactics changed over time too. And this is both due to, as you said, in the recent years, more increased awareness of the AI topics, but also because I grew more comfortable in my own skin. And there was a time, and I'm not proud of this, but there was a time earlier in my career where I knew a ton about cars. To a point that when a car passes by, I could tell you not only the make model year, but also the engine size, the horsepower, zero 60 time, all of that. And honestly, I didn't start learning about them because I was particularly interested in cars, but because it was one of the main topics of my peer group. In an effort not to be sidelined, I felt like I had to know a lot about them. This is how it started. So that's the initial strategy morphed over time to search for a common ground instead of that full assimilation. And then eventually me deciding to show up as authentically as I could and hope that the value I bring to the table is important enough for the other party to do their fair share to make the conversation inclusive. And that, do I still have to do something extra to ensure my voice is heard? Still, absolutely. And there are times, go ahead. No, I love this. I love this idea of, you know, that's why we have Ben and Rome do as Romans do. So you probably tried to do that first and got your voice heard. And then you took the time to let them understand who you are as an individual. I think that works. That's a great tactic. Yeah. And honestly, there was a part of people getting to know me, but also there was a part of me growing up, I'm going to say, to, you know, like, this is who I am. And times are changing. So why don't you do your share to make the conversation inclusive? Yeah. So discovering yourself and then putting yourself out there. Yep. Yep. Exactly. And then you're able to see the people in your skin. Yep. Yep. And, but yeah, but I mean, it doesn't mean that I reached the destination. You know, there's still a lot of work to do. As I said, you know, I'm still employing some tactics to ensure my voice is heard. And it's like sometimes paraphrasing what I said, sometimes, you know, looking for the additional data points to make the message land better. Sometimes it is, you know, is this the right angle, the right person, right time and all of those things. So they are still things that are going through my mind still to this day. But what I realized, Pallavi, is although I've come a long way in self-advocacy, I am much more fierce when it comes to advocating for others. Yeah. It is so much easier for me to say that, hey, you're repeating what she said, or it was her idea, rather than saying it was my idea, you're repeating my words. So I really lean into that. And I, by leaning into that, I, by lifting others up, by supporting others, I hope to use that fierceness to make the world a more just, more equitable place, specifically for women in technology, but for any of the minorities again, like women minorities, the major majority of minorities. But that is something that comes more natural to me to advocate for others. So more power to you, Hale, for giving. So basically, if you're saying to get more fierce in making sure that the others are getting an opportunity or uplifted or not being sidelined, that's huge. That's probably what we really, the world really needs that. And I think in that journey, when you're trying to uplift others, you're also maturing your own self and you're growing internally too. Yeah, definitely. And making the environment a little bit better too. So much more. Yeah. And everybody needs that positivity. And then I think it's a ripple effect, right? When others see you doing this, they're also encouraged and they step in and do more. Very true. Yeah. That's beautiful. That's lovely. So Hale, you just say that you're an executive coach, and I wanted to understand what your approach to mentorship is and how you have incorporated that into your organization. Yeah. So some people are natural mentors and we really are super lucky to have a few of them, quite a few of them in my organization, but we didn't have a formal structured program. So last year, two women engineers approached me and shout out to Jyoti Shetty and Somia Sitaram here. They approached me to brainstorm about how we could make it an official and structured program. I'm passionate about this, so it was an easy yes from me. And we looked in our HRBP and came up with resources, guidelines, processes, et cetera. Since this was going to be the first program in the organization, first official program in the organization, we wanted to secure the supply side of this whole place. So we confirmed a few mentors beforehand and then asked for nominations for both mentors and mentees, matched them accordingly, and ran a pilot in the engineering last year. So we were talking about how it impacts the women in technology and whatnot. In our pilot program, Pallavi, we had equal representation from both women and men, and our ratio is not 50-50 in engineering. So this was another sign to me to see how real the need is for that mentorship for women in technology. We don't have enough representation, not only in the leadership positions, but also in higher level individual contributor roles too. And if you think about it in a larger space, there are still advancement barriers, pay inequities, family, work-life imbalances for women in the workplace. And mentorship is a great way to address those, build connections, real connections, and work through charting your path to your goals, gaining skills, and learning new things. So that was a really starting thing for me to know that attendance level. And in general, mentors and coaches and sponsors, to a certain extent, they help you unlock your potential and get you where you want to be in a much shorter time. The playing level is not filled at the moment. So this is one of the ways we can work to close that gap for women, at least. Right. Yeah. And as you rightly said, a lot of times these mentors may just unlock your own potential. They're not teaching you anything new, but just the connection and the network can help you discover your own greatness. Yes. Very true. Very true. Sometimes all we need is a little push or a spotlight in our blind spots. Right. So, Halle, tell me this. My next question would have been, how can companies structure result-oriented programs that unlock every team member's full potential? But before that, I think it might be important to look at what are the typical challenges that companies face? And not every company may face all the challenges for structuring this program. But what have you seen? What are the typical challenges that once you break through those, then it's easier to structure a program? Yeah. I think the first thing is basically thinking from a company point of view and also the bigger climate of tech that we are at this moment in time. Engagement, employee engagement, retention, really making sure that we are upskilling the employees. And that word that treat everybody really well or teach them well so that they can leave anytime they want to, but treat them really well so that they don't want to. That fine balance of upskilling and keeping them engaged and have them growing is one of the biggest things, I think, at this point. And if the company is bought into that, so that's one part of it, is if the company is excited and have resources to spend on that, that's one big part of it. And the second part is sometimes it is kind of a grassroots moment, like we had, right? We were just in the engineering group. Can we make something happen? And having those individuals that are willing to do the work and at least speak for it, fight for it, if they come together, it is really, really magical. But for companies in general, because your resources are always limited, right? So you want to pick and choose what will bring you the best possible results. So tying this to the initial question of yours is how do we know that we are getting the results? Yes, we are going to like allaking every team member's full potential is super critical. And mentorship is one of the ways, but you can really focus on where people are, where they want to go, how you can bridge that gap and all. But what are the results that you want to get out of this? So I'm a big believer in you can't improve what you don't measure. So thinking about the results from the get-go becomes really, really important. So you pick up your objectives and you pick up some measurable key results. It can be engagement score, for example, for the organization, can be really important. But when it comes to results, I think there are two crucial parts. The first one is the results for the individual, which is mentor and mentee, right? For mentors, what are you trying to get for the mentors out of this other than the altruistic goodwill nature of it? It can be honing their leadership skills. It can be sharing the organizational knowledge and business knowledge with others. For mentees, it is having people to talk to, increasing your inorganization resources, crafting your skills, learning new things. So these are all the things, but what becomes important then is how do you pick that result? How do you pick that goal for the pair? So what we do in our program is we ask the pair to pick a goal for themselves. And measure their progress towards that goal throughout the program and at the end of it. And we will know if you achieve. This is fully knowing that life happens. Your goals may shift, the relationship may shift, but we encourage them to continue the relationship if both wants to, and also take part of the program in different roles with different pairings. So when you talk about reaching your full potential, nobody can give you everything that you need to reach your full potential. So I personally like talking to people with different skill sets, different backgrounds, different perspectives to get a little bit of everything. And this is what we encourage in our mentorship program too. The second crucial part, we talked about the individuals, the second is for the organization. And these are the things usually that the engagement scores, retention scores, upskilling your employees, supporting inclusion, providing more learning and development opportunities. And I believe if you start with the potential, the end result that you hope for in mind, that goes a long way and may even ensure the successful outcome of the program. That's true. So Hanif, I really love how you have that whole understanding. Can you also share with us any life example of where you saw a change in somebody's trajectory because of the mentorship program and how it started, how just a couple of examples would really help. Yeah. So we were thinking about, I'm going to talk about one of the first meetings of one of the mentor mentee meetings. And we've started with what are the goals, like mentee starts with what are the goals that I want to pick and I want to go into XYZ without giving too much into their privacy, but I want to talk about XYZ and I want to go to these places. But the question that the mentor asked was why? And first response is because I want to grow in my career and I think these are the things that I want to do, da da da da. And then second why and third why. I mean, this is such a simple thing, right? But it turned out that they were going through the motions, but not really happy with what they were doing. There were parts of it that they loved and they wanted to grow and there were parts of it that was just draining them down. So by shining that light into that blind spot of you're not a tree, you don't have to be there. You can change positions, you can move to another place. You know? Yeah, be more organic. Exactly. So that understanding made them consider what they want about the job and what they don't like about the job, that current job position that they're in. And how can they morph it into something different to do more of the things that they want and grow in different ways that they want to go? And they got the support that they needed to talk to other people and find a better spot for them. So this is actually a good example of how we talked about, we set a goal at the beginning of the program. It completely changed towards the end of the program. But if you were to ask if that was a successful outcome of the program, even though the initial goals were not met, I would totally say it was. It was an experience in listening to what you want and not going by the book, like questioning your motives and thinking out of the box to see if there's another way possible, if there's another way possible for you to go and pick that for yourself. So that's the first example that came to my mind. Lovely. Fali, I was also, you know, during everything that you were saying, I was also thinking that we assume all of this requires a lot of self-motivation, right? And not everybody has the self-motivation or the drive because it may be because of the circumstances that they just succumb to. And especially with women, there are a lot of women who take a break in their career and they take a break in the early part of their career, you know, when they just had a few years of experience and then because of family life or motherhood or something, they may take a break, right? They've not reached a position where they have a whole lot of confidence in themselves yet. So after the break, when they want to come back into the world, into the corporate world, there's a lot of, there is a lack of drive and motivation. There's some amount of being lost. There's some hesitant in putting yourself out there, right? So for such women, what would be, what would be your advice? So it pushes them out and it motivates them. That is a great question, Pallavi, and it kind of hits close to home. When I had my second child, I was, I think I was due for promotion, but I did not go and ask for it because I thought it'll require me to take away from my family time. It'll require me to not be as present that I would like to be. And I wanted to balance that right. Looking back, I should have. But one thing, now what you're asking is, is there anything in the environment that would have made me more bold into asking that question or push myself and get that motivation? And that is, there are two parts of it. Let me start with two parts. I don't know if we're going to end up with two parts, but there are two parts of it. It may be lack of motivation, but I think it is more of a complete lack of planning and making sure that we do all of it all at the same time. So one part of it is really looking at what you want to do and are there other people that you can go and talk to? So that is the representation part of it. If you know that there are other people who have gone through that and made it, go talk to them, ask their advice, learn from their experiences, hear their stories. I think that is the part that makes us, you know, oh, okay, okay, I could do that. Or learn from what you didn't do. Like I, I'm like, I'm regretting it. I totally deserve that promotion, but I didn't put myself out there. So that can be motivating too. And the second part is a little bit about the environment. So if there is a mentorship program available, it is easier to take part of it, be a part of it rather than going and asking for somebody to be your mentor. So two parts, representation and available opportunities so that they can be pushed a little bit out or it is not a push, it is easier for them to grab. That's so true. And sometimes I also feel, Hare, that you may not have a formal mentorship program available to you, but that's, but there could be mentorship opportunities lying right in front of you. And I think everybody should take that small step. Sometimes it feels like a huge step to go ask somebody, but even if you just strike a conversation and want to get to know somebody better, like somebody who's more experienced, somebody whom you respect, somebody who you, who you like the trajectory for, just a conversation can open up a lot of your own doors. And I feel like in those times you have to trust your own intuition, judgment and intelligence to absorb it. Yeah. All out there. Which is very true. And that's a great point. You know, asking for somebody to mentor you sounds like a big ask and you're, you know, like especially if it is the first time, if you don't know that person, you're kind of locking yourself into that relationship and asking a lot of time from them too. There are a ton of micro mentorship, micro mentorship opportunities. You just learn something from that person and it is really a low hanging fruit in that sense that you're just having a conversation and you're having that micro learning moment. And then you have another conversation, maybe at another time with somebody else. So it can be diverse. It doesn't have to be one person. And definitely whenever they are out there, as you said, this makes it so much social, so much organic, so much conversational, yet you come up, come out with something very meaningful for your growth at the end. Yeah, and you don't understand sometimes the other person may also gain a lot. Like he or she may sound like he's, oh, he's way out of my league or way up there. But you may bring a very fresh perspective to their mundane daily, you know, talking at that C-suite level. It's very nice to hear that perspective. Like I've seen that myself so many times where those conversations are so engaging and they're, you know, they're nothing but they're real, very real. Very real. You're right. You're right. I think that is one of the not so talked about benefits of mentorship programs. Everybody identifies for organization and mentees. There's a lot for mentors in there too. That is just not, that is just more hidden than the rest of the obvious ones. I love that point. There is a lot for the mentors as well. So don't shy away from asking for advice and thoughts. Sometimes you're not even asking for an advisor. You may ask for just what's your thought on this. And that can open up a whole discussion. And the other thing that you've said that I really like and should talk about it more at another time would be the micro mentorship and the micro mentorship. It doesn't have to sound so formal. It can be very, very casual too. Great. So Halei, you were at our conference last year and we would love to see you again at the conference, the Exordiary Women in Tech conference. But then just before we end the session, is there anything that you'd like to say to the audience based on your journey, what you saw and the importance of these kind of networking events? Yeah. The conference was really good. It was great. We've talked about this. Women in Tech is a lonely place, especially as you climb up the career ladder. And I mentioned the lack of representation. And it was like a fresh breath of air really to see people who made it. And this kind of affirms your belief that it is doable. So that is the representation part of it. And learning there how. It was good to get to know like-minded people, hear their stories and make new and meaningful connections with them. So this is all the networking events and the support groups for Women in Tech. That is what they provide you. They provide you with a representation, with possibilities and way to support and lead each other up. So this is where the sisterhood that is talked about, that you get to share your experiences, learn from others and really be in the company of like-minded people. It gives the feeling that we are not alone, not in our organizations or we are not one of a few in our organizations, but also in the issues that we are trying to navigate. We are all going through the same things. And with that, the networking events, your conference in particular and support groups for Women in general, they reignite the hope and remind us of our responsibility to go further, not just individuals, but also our responsibility to move the cause forward, to make the world a more just, more equitable place. So it was a great reminder of that and I really tremendously enjoyed it. I'm so glad. Yes, I agree. These are, you know, if nothing else, these are very light, enriching events and conversations. And thank you for you. Thank you to you for being such an integral part of it and for always being so involved in all our events. I really appreciate that. And thank you so much for your time today as well. Thank you very much, Pallavi. It was my pleasure and looking forward to seeing you in the next conference. In October. Yes.
